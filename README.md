# Scenario
## While progressing in your development for the Little Lemon app UI, you are tasked to build a login screen. You have learned about some built-in composables and basic layouts, and have become familiar with Android Studio. It is the right time for you to test your understanding with this interesting task.

# Scenario

In the previously developed Little Lemon login screen, the user could not input any text in the login fields. The button clicks didn’t work, and the spacing between the elements wasn’t right. You’ll do exactly those tasks in this exercise since you have learned about state and how Compose lets you manage state.
